# Overview


This is a simple web scraper (using rvest) that tries to find how many first links it takes to get from a random wikipedia article to the philosophy article.

This is mostly to practicle different languages, R is quite outside of anything else I have worked with before so I learned a lot about it. Originally I was going to some data analysis on popular youtube channels but getting data out of youtube ended up being outside the scope of this project.

# Development Environment

This was made in visual studio code, and in the R language with the rvest and polite modules.
Initially I thought that R was a funny choice to make a web scraping model in, but it makes sense considering a lot of the common goals web scrapers actually have.

# Future Work

Like I said really when I started this I wanted to make a version that chrunched numbers from youtube. I planned on getting the 100 most popular videos from the site and graphing the subscriber count of the channel to the view count of the video. the best fit slope of the line and such would give an inidcator as to how many of the top videos on youtube are one hit wonders so to speak.
